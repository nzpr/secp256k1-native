# secp256k1 Native Libraries
This repository creates standard builds of the secp256k1 native library. It packages the built libraries into operating system-specific JARs (with POMs). This allows secp256k1-java (or other interested Java projects) to depend on these JARs using the normal Maven dependency resolution process.

The following dependencies are required (plus Java and Maven):

* `autotools-dev`
* `autoconf`
* `build-essentials`
* `gcc` (Linux) or `clang` (OS X) for building the shared library
* NOTE: for arm64 build Azul JDKs is required.

For Mac this combination is enough:
* `brew install autoconf`
* `brew install automake`
    
### Installation

This project is mainly intended to be built by Travis CI, as a Linux operating system is required to build the Linux library, and an OS X operating system is needed to build the OS X library. Nevertheless it is possible to execute the Linux or OS X component of the build locally.

Once the platform dependencies are met:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rchain/secp256k1-native.git
cd secp256k1-native
mvn clean install
```

An appropriate Maven profile will automatically be used for Linux or OS X.
